 * NEW CUSTOMER SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
 * ========================================================
 * 
 * OVERVIEW:
 * This system creates a realistic security monitoring game where players must
 * observe customers over time to identify thieves based on warning signs.
 * 
 * KEY FEATURES:
 * 1. Predetermined Warning System
 * 2. Smart Shelf Navigation
 * 3. Risk-Based Decision Making
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * 1. CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR SYSTEM (Thief.cs)
 * =======================================
 * 
 * AT SPAWN:
 * - Each customer is predetermined as thief or regular customer
 * - Thieves: Will show exactly 3 warning signs (confirmed thief status)
 * - Regular customers: Will show 0-2 warning signs (never confirmed thief)
 * 
 * MOVEMENT:
 * - Navigate to random shelf checkpoints (tagged "ShelfCheckpoint")
 * - Face nearest shelf landmarks (tagged "ShelfLandmark") for realistic browsing
 * - Continuous movement between different shelf areas
 * 
 * WARNING SIGNS:
 * - Display at regular intervals (configurable timing)
 * - Player must observe and count warnings to make decisions
 * - Warning signs are temporary visual indicators (3 seconds default)
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * 2. SCORING SYSTEM (GameManager.cs)
 * ===================================
 * 
 * APPREHEND DECISION (Y key):
 * - Confirmed thief (3+ warnings): +100 points, customer removed
 * - Innocent customer (0 warnings): -50 points, customer continues
 * - Suspicious customer (1-2 warnings): -25 points, customer continues
 * 
 * RELEASE DECISION (N key):
 * - Confirmed thief: -75 points (thief escapes)
 * - Innocent/Suspicious: +10 points (correct decision)
 * 
 * STRATEGY:
 * - Wait for 3 warnings to confirm thief status
 * - Early apprehension risks penalties
 * - Letting thieves escape costs more than wrong apprehension
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * 3. SETUP REQUIREMENTS
 * =====================
 * 
 * SHELF SYSTEM:
 * - Create empty GameObjects around shelf areas
 * - Tag some as "ShelfCheckpoint" (where customers walk to)
 * - Tag others as "ShelfLandmark" (what customers face while browsing)
 * - Use ShelfSystem.cs component for easy setup and visualization
 * 
 * CUSTOMER PREFAB:
 * - Attach updated Thief.cs script
 * - Include NavMeshAgent component
 * - Add Animator (optional, for walking animations)
 * - Include warning sign GameObject (child object, initially inactive)
 * 
 * GAMEMANAGER SETUP:
 * - Assign customer prefab (not thief prefab)
 * - Set spawn point Transform
 * - Configure spawn intervals and thief spawn chance
 * - Assign UI elements (popup, score text, instructions text)
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * 4. GAMEPLAY FLOW
 * =================
 * 
 * 1. Customer spawns with predetermined warning count
 * 2. Customer navigates to random shelf locations
 * 3. Customer faces shelves realistically using landmarks
 * 4. Warning signs appear at intervals (if any predetermined)
 * 5. Player observes through CCTV and counts warnings
 * 6. Player makes apprehension decision at any time
 * 7. Scoring based on accuracy of decision vs actual thief status
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * 5. DEBUGGING FEATURES
 * =====================
 * 
 * Console logs show:
 * - Customer spawn type (THIEF/REGULAR)
 * - Predetermined warning counts
 * - Warning sign displays
 * - Navigation decisions
 * - Scoring results
 * 
 * Visual helpers:
 * - ShelfSystem gizmos show checkpoint/landmark positions
 * - Debug rays show CCTV raycasting
 * - Glow effects highlight interactive customers
